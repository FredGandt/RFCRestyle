# RFCRestyle
An open source Chrome extension, first published on the Chrome webstore in early 2013, that restyles ietf.org RFC and Draft documents for reading comfort. Visit: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rfcrestyle/babdjpjkdmdppnlgjlpgiknmbdblmdbd to install or read its accompanying change log and documentation.

Note: The RFCRestyle subdirectory contains the deminified (not unminified) code, identical in every way to the parent directory's code, except for the inclusion of vast quantities of the useless whitespace humans require to visually parse the info.
