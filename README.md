The "Expanded" subdirectory contains identical code to that in the parent directory, except for the inclusion of vast quantities of the useless whitespace, a few braces and some semicolons.

The "Deminified" subdirectory contains code that is functionally identical to that of the parent directory, but is rewritten to be comfortably human readable. Some slight differences in the methodology of the code exist as a side effect of the removal of minification.
